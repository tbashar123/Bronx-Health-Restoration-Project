	</span></b></i></center>

	<p>Everyone experiences stress and anxiety some point in their life. When that occurs, some people in the Bronx go towards drugs 
	and alcohol to relieve it. Drugs and Alcohol may make you feel good but the risks are DEADLY. These risks include many diseases, for example heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the Bronx.
	Instead everyone should exercise when they feel stressed and anxious. When you exercise, your body releases feel-good brain chemicals that may ease depression 
	(Neurotransmitters, Endorphins, and Endocannabinoids). It increases body temperature, which may have calming effects, and reducing 
	immune system chemicals that can worsen depression. </p>
